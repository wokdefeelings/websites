        <h1>Announcing a free GitHub Copilot for VS Code</h1>
        <p>December 18, 2024 by Burke Holland, @burkeholland</p>
        <p>
          We're excited to announce an all new free plan for GitHub Copilot,
          available for everyone today in VS Code. All you need is a GitHub
          account. No trial. No subscription. No credit card required.
        </p>
        <p>
          <Link href="#">Enable GitHub Copilot Free</Link>
        </p>
        <p>
          You can click on the link above or just enable GitHub Copilot right
          from within VS Code like so...
        </p>
        <video
          className={main__video}
          controls
          poster="https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/blogs/2024/12/18/copilot-free.jpg"
          src="https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/blogs/2024/12/18/blog-video-v2.mp4"
          title="Copilot Edits Video"
        />
        <p>
          With GitHub Copilot Free you get 2000 code completions/month. That's
          about 80 per working day - which is a lot. You also get 50 chat
          requests/month, as well as access to both GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet
          models.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you hit these limits, ideally it's because Copilot is doing its job
          well, which is to help you do yours! If you find you need more
          Copilot, the <Link href="#">paid Pro plan</Link> is unlimited and
          provides access to additional models like o1 and Gemini (coming in the
          new year).
        </p>
        <p>
          With this announcement, GitHub Copilot becomes a core part of the VS
          Code experience. The team has been hard at work, as always, improving
          that experience with brand new AI features and capabilities. Letâ€™s
          take a look at some of the newer additions to GitHub Copilot that
          dropped in just the past few months. This is your editor, redefined
          with AI.

        </h2>
        <p>
          <Link href="#">Copilot Edits</Link> is a multi-file editing experience
          that you can open from the top of the chat side bar. Given a prompt,
          Edits will propose changes across files including creating new files
          when needed. This gives you the conversational flow of chat combined
          with the power of Copilot's code generation capabilities. The result
          is something you have to try to believe.

        <p>
          Tell GitHub Copilot exactly how you want things done with{" "}
          <Link href="#">custom instructions</Link>. These instructions are
          passed to the model with every request, allowing you to specify your
          preferences and the details that the model needs to know to write code
          the way you want it.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can specify these at the editor or project level. We'll even pick
          them up automatically if you include a{" "}
          <code>.github/copilot-instructions.md</code> file in your project.
          These instructions can easily be shared with your team, so everyone
          can be on the same page - including GitHub Copilot.

          GitHub Copilot has AI powered domain experts that you can mention with
          the <code>@</code> syntax. We call these, "participants". The{" "}
          <code>@workspace</code> <Link href="#">participant</Link> is a domain
          expert in the area of your entire codebase.

          GitHub Copilot will also do intent detection (as seen in the video)
          and include the <code>@workspace</code> automatically if it sees you
          are asking a question that requires full project context.

          Try this: Type <code>/help</code> into the chat prompt to see a list
          of all the particpants in GitHub Copilot and their various areas of
          expertise, as well as slash commands that can greatly reduce
          prompting.

          For instance, I know that I can use the{" "}

          Try this: Mock up a UI using Figma or Sketch (or PowerPoint - it's ok
          if you do that. I do it too). Then use <code>@vision</code> to

          Note: Vision is in preview today and requires you to have your own
